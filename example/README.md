# `npm-install-loader` Example

## Usage

It's recommended to install the same version of Node this is tested against:

```shell
$ nvm install
$ nvm use
```

Install dependencies required to start working:

```shell
$ npm install
```

Start the server that (that doesn't do anything yet):

```shell
$ npm start
```

Finally, make changes to `server.js` and watch dependencies get installed
as you go!
